    The :class:`SmoothConvexFunction` implements smooth convex functions as particular cases
    of :class:`SmoothStronglyConvexFunction`.

    Attributes:
        L (float): smoothness parameter

    Smooth convex functions are characterized by the smoothness parameter :math:`L`,
    hence can be instantiated as

    Example:
        >>> from PEPit import PEP
        >>> from PEPit.functions import SmoothConvexFunction

        >>> func = problem.declare_function(function_class=SmoothConvexFunction, L=1.)

        Args:

                                       Keys are :class:`Function` objects and values are their associated coefficients.

                                   If False, a new subgradient is computed each time one is required.

        Note:
            Smooth convex functions are necessarily differentiable, hence `reuse_gradient` is set to True.
