TODO's:

- in pep.py -> routine for checking accuracies (primal, dual, & primal-dual)
- in wrappers -> accurately compute dual objectives (currently do not take into account constant terms from LMIs)
- add tests (incl: for wrappers & for both solvers)
- update the "output" of the examples for the documentation
- update the documentation.
- comments in mosek_wrapper.py & cvxpy_wrapper.py

--- others: (not done at all)
- naming points + constraints?
