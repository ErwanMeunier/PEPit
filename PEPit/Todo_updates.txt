TODO's:

---Tests:
- add asserts in the new code
- add tests, including for:
	- for wrappers & for both solvers
	- for dual objectives (in particular, test what happens if we put equality initial conditions (instead of <=)---should check that the signs are handled correctly.
	- should test for PSD constraints with (a few) constants entries/values. (this is already done in a few examples now--should check consistency of the dual objective)

---Others: (not done at all)
- naming points + constraints?

---documentation:
- update the documentation.

--- Examples:
- Updater les outputs des examples
- Une fois les outputs modifiÃ©s -> updater l'output 'exemple' du papier.
