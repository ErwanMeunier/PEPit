TODO's:

---accuracies
- in pep.py -> routine for checking accuracies (primal, dual, & primal-dual)
- in wrappers -> accurately compute dual objectives (currently do not take into account constant terms from LMIs)

---documentation:
- update the "output" of the examples for the documentation
- update the documentation.

---tests:
- add asserts in the new code
- add tests, including for:
	- for wrappers & for both solvers
	- for dual objectives (in particular, test what happens if we put equality initial conditions (instead of <=)
	- should test for PSD constraints with (a few) constants entries/values.

---others: (not done at all)
- naming points + constraints?
