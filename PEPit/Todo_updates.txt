Note: all those updates are required for submitting the revision.

TODO's:
---Questions (please add yours):
- should we really return the "problems" (CVXPY problem, MOSEK task) to the user? to the main PEP class?

---accuracies // duals
- in pep.py -> routine for checking accuracies (primal, dual, & primal-dual)

---documentation:
- update the "output" of the examples for the documentation
- update the documentation.

---tests:
- add asserts in the new code
- add tests, including for:
	- for wrappers & for both solvers
	- for dual objectives (in particular, test what happens if we put equality initial conditions (instead of <=)---should check that the signs are handled correctly.
	- should test for PSD constraints with (a few) constants entries/values. (this is already done in a few examples now--should check consistency of the dual objective)

---Git/tests:
- comment nous assurer que certains (ou mieux: tous les) tests puissent être sur mosek?

---Others: (not done at all)
- naming points + constraints?

--- Functions:
Smooth convex Lip

--- Examples:
- the output of the upper bound should be the dual value (and not the primal value)
- une fois les outputs modifiés -> updater l'output 'exemple' du papier.
