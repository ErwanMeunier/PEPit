    See description in `PEPit/examples/unconstrained_convex_minimization/proximal_point.py`.
    This example is for testing purposes; the worst-case result is supposed to be the same as that of the other routine,
    but the parameterization is different (convex function to be minimized is explicitly formed as a sum of two convex
    functions). That is, the minimization problem is

    .. math:: f_\\star = \\min_x \\{f(x) \\equiv f_1(x) + f_2(x)\\},

    where :math:`f_1` and :math:`f_2` are closed, proper, and convex (and potentially non-smooth) functions.
    In addition, we also specify the initial condition is an LMI.
    
    Args:
        gamma (float): the step size parameter.
        n (int): number of iterations.
        verbose (int): Level of information details to print.

                        - -1: No verbose at all.
                        - 0: This example's output.
                        - 1: This example's output + PEPit information.
                        - 2: This example's output + PEPit information + CVXPY details.

    Returns:
        tuple: worst_case value, theoretical value

        >>> pepit_tau, theoretical_tau = wc_proximal_point_complexified3(gamma=1, n=2, verbose=1)
