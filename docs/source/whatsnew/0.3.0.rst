What's new in PEPit 0.3.0
=========================


- The :class:`BlockPartition` has been created and allows to decompose the space into orthogonal subspaces to treat points differently in each subspaces. This is useful in particular to study Coordinate Descent like method or block adaptive AdaGrad like methods.

- Operators classes :class:`CocoerciveStronglyMonotoneOperator` and :class:`NegativelyComonotoneOperator` have been added.
