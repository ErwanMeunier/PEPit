What's new in PEPit 0.3.0
=========================


For users:
----------

- The :class:`BlockPartition` has been created and allows to decompose the space into orthogonal subspaces to treat points differently in each subspaces. This is useful in particular to study Coordinate Descent like methods.

- Operators classes :class:`CocoerciveStronglyMonotoneOperator` and :class:`NegativelyComonotoneOperator` as well as the Function class :class:`SmoothConvexLipschitzFunction` have been added.

- Most operators classes had redundant class constraints. They have been removed.

- Add argument `wrapper` in solve set to `cvxpy` by default. If `wrapper` is set to `cvxpy`, the routine is unchanged compared to PEPit 0.2.1. If `wrapper` is set to `mosek`, PEPit bypasses CVXPY and run MOSEK directly.

- Remove possibility to return full problem with pep.solve. Instead, the pep object possesses a lot of attributes with all the details.

- PEP.solve now returns the dual value of the objective by default, i.e. the actually worst-case guarantee. The user can still call `PEP.solve` with the option `return_primal_or_dual == "primal"` to get the primal value of the objective corresponding to a counter example. Note, those two values should be almost identical by strong duality. A new list of messages are printed to verify feasibility of the provided solution and provides duality gap.

- The order of the constraints of `SmoothFunction` has been reversed to be consistent with `ConvexFunction`, `StronglyConvexFunction`, `SmoothConvexFunction` and `SmoothStronglyConvexFunction`.

- Point, Expression, Constraint, PSDMatrix and Function objects now have an attribute "name" that contains a string representing them. The latter is initialized from the argument name when creating the object (set to None by default), and get updated through the methods `set_name`. Finally they are accessible through the methods `get_name`.

- The class interpolation constraints are automatically named after the function name and the points names. To fully enjoy this feature, it is recommended to give a name to those entities.

- Each function now possess an attribute `tables_of_constraints` storing the class constraints in a nice readable way. To access the dual values of all interpolation constraints in readable tables, use the method `get_class_constraints_duals`. It returns a dictionary whose values are pandas DataFrames.


For contributors only:
----------------------

- Creating a new class of functions / operator previously required to overwrite the method `set_class_constraints`. This method has been renamed into `add_class_constraints`, while `set_class_constraints` is implemented in the class `Function` and calls `add_class_constraints`.

- In order to simplify the implementation of the functions / operators classes, a method `add_constraints_from_lists_of_points` have been added to the class `Function`. A contributor adding a function / operator class can use it in `add_class_constraints`. `add_constraints_from_lists_of_points` takes lists of points in arguments as well as a method that returns a named constraint from 2 points, their names and the function name. Please refer to `the implemented functions / operators classes <https://pepit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/functions_and_operators.html>`_ as examples.
