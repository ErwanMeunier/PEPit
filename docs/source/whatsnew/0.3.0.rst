What's new in PEPit 0.3.0
=========================


- The :class:`BlockPartition` has been created and allows to decompose the space into orthogonal subspaces to treat points differently in each subspaces. This is useful in particular to study Coordinate Descent like methods.

- Operators classes :class:`CocoerciveStronglyMonotoneOperator` and :class:`NegativelyComonotoneOperator` as well as the Function class :class:`SmoothConvexLipschitzFunction` have been added.

- Most operators classes had redundant class constraints. They have been removed.
